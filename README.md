# Pub-Sub C project

This project is a classic publish-subscribe system implemented in C as part of a systems programming course I took at university. The system uses the pthread library to implement a multi-threaded HTTP server to serve clients. 

## Features

- Publish-Subscribe: The system allows clients to subscribe to topics and receive published messages related to those topics.
- HTTP Server: The project includes an HTTP server implemented in C, which uses multithreading to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- User Statistics: The system tracks and accumulates statistics on current users, providing insights into user activity and usage patterns.
